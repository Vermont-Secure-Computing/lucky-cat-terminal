LCTerm is a free and open-source Android Point-of-Sale application
designed for merchants to accept and verify cryptocurrency payments.

It supports multiple assets, QR code generation, conversion at current market
values, and receipt printing, to enable point of sale transactions.  LCTerm is 
not a wallet and holds no funds, rather it verifies the customer payments are 
made to addresses specified by business owners.  

To use LCTerm a merchant must have an API key available at Vericeive.com.  

This project is developed by Vermont Secure Computing and is fully open
source for transparency and community trust.
