LCTerm is a free and open-source Android Point-of-Sale application
designed for merchants who accept cryptocurrency payments.

It supports multiple assets, QR code generation, and real-time
transaction monitoring. LCTerm runs offline after initial setup and
protects merchant privacy by avoiding third-party analytics.

This project is developed by Vermont Secure Computing and is fully open
source for transparency and community trust.
