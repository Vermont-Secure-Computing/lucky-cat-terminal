LCTerm is a free and open-source Android Point-of-Sale application
designed for merchants to accept and verify cryptocurrency payments.  
It runs on all android devices but was designed for android point-of-sale 
devices with a thermal receipt printer.  

It supports multiple assets, QR code generation, conversion at current market
values, local currencies, and receipt printing, to enable point of sale transactions.  
LCTerm is not a wallet and holds no funds, rather it verifies the customer payments are 
made to addresses specified by business owners.  

To use LCTerm a merchant must have an API key available at Vericeive.com.  

This project is developed by Vermont Secure Computing and is fully open
source for transparency and community trust.
